# Backchannel

Backchannel is a cross platform progressive web application combining novel
out-of-band identity verification techniques with a modernised pet name address book system. 

This prototype will allow two people to share documents safely over time in
a cohesive, easily understood interface. It will satisfy certain
cases of heightened risk without dramatic configuration or expertise required
on behalf of network participants.
