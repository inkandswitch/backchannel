# Backchannel

This project proposes a cross platform desktop application consisting of
a novel combination of out-of-band identity verification techniques backed by
strong cryptography, and supported by a modernised Pet Name address book
system. This prototype will allow two people to share content safely in
a cohesive, easily understood interface. This prototype will satisfy certain
cases of heightened risk without dramatic configuration or expertise required
on behalf of network participants.
